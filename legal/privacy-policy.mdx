## 7. International Data Transfers

The Services are hosted in the United States. If you choose to use the Services from regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your personal data outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing, which may not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.

If you are based in the EU or UK, please note that, while the United States has personal data privacy laws that are different from your country, and the United States has not received an adequacy decision from the European Union Commission, we will ensure that your personal data is protected in a manner that is consistent with how your personal data is protected if it was processed in your country. For additional information on rights that you have under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), visit the GDPR Notice page on our Website.

## 9. Interest-Based Advertising

We do not control third parties’ collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way. You can block the collection and use of information related to you by advertising companies for the purpose of serving interest-based advertising by visiting the following platforms of self-regulatory programs of which those companies are members:

## 10. Social Networks, Third-Party Links, Forums

Our Services may integrate social network plugins, include links to third-party websites or services, or provide you the opportunity to post content. Please keep the following in mind:

- **Social Networks.** Our websites may make available the option for you to use social network “plugins” that are operated by social media companies. If you choose to use one of these plugins, then it may collect information about you and send it back to the social media company that owns it. This may happen even if you do not click on the plugin, if you are logged into the social media website that owns the plugin when you access our Services. Information collected by a plugin is subject to the privacy policy and terms of the social media company that owns it. If you do not want the applicable social media company to collect information about you when you use our Services, sign out of the social media network before visiting. By interacting with a plugin when you use our Services (for example, clicking the Facebook “Like” button), you are knowingly transferring information to that social media company. Further, if you are logged into a social media website when you visit our websites, then you are directing us to share your data with the social media company that owns the plugin.
- **Third-party links.** Our Services may link to or contain links to third-party websites that we do not control or maintain, such as in connection with purchasing products we may recommend or reference via our Services and/or advertisements you may see while using our Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third-party website. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of all third-party websites before submitting any personally identifiable information through these websites.
- **Forums.** We may offer chat rooms, blogs, message boards, or similar public forums where you and other users of our Services can share information and communicate – e.g., places where you can post your profile. The protections described in this Privacy Policy do not apply when you post information (including personal information) to these forums. And we may use personal information to identify you with a post on any such forum. Any information you share with or on these forums is public information and may be seen or collected by anyone, including third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for events arising from the distribution of any information you choose to publicly post or share through our Services.

## 11. Your Rights and Choices

Your rights may vary depending on where you are located. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:

- **Marketing/Notifications.** If you do not want us to use your email address or other contact information to promote or recommend our own products and services, or third parties’ products or services, you can adjust your preferences by contacting us as set forth below in the Contact Us section. This opt-out generally will not apply to information provided to us as a result of a product purchase, warranty registration, product service experience or other transactions.
- **Accessing, updating, and deleting your information.** If you have an account with us, you may have the ability to access your information and make updates to or delete your data. If not, you can contact us as set forth in the Contact Us section below to request access to, correction of, or deletion of personal information that you have provided to us. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or negatively affect the information’s accuracy.

If we receive your personal data in the context of providing problem solving services to you, we will securely accept that data, segregate it from other customer data, and limit access to the data. We will delete the data once the issue is resolved.

In general, we will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, or we have obtained your consent.

- **Location Information.** When you use our Services, particularly our Application(s), we may automatically collect certain Equipment (mobile device) specific information. This includes the general or specific location of your Equipment through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals. Before we collect or send location-specific information, it is our practice to ask for your consent. In some instances, your operating system may not allow you to install an Application without giving us consent. In all instances, you may withdraw your consent by disabling location features for your Equipment.
- **Cookies and automatic data collection technologies.** You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings used for browser cookies. To learn how you can manage your Flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe’s website. However, if you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the Services may become inaccessible or not function properly.
- **Interest Based Advertising.** Please see Interest-Based Advertising above for information on how to opt-out of interest-based advertising.
